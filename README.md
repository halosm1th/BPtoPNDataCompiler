## ❓ Troubleshooting

* **`dotnet: command not found`**
  Ensure the .NET SDK is correctly installed and added to your `$PATH`.

* **Project not building?**
  Make sure you're using the right version of the .NET SDK. Check the `.csproj` file for the target framework (e.g., `net6.0`) and install the corresponding SDK version.
